 * string table data
 * 
 * this table contains the raw character data for each string
 * 
 * unsigned short - number of indices in the table
 * unsigned short - number of languages in the table
 * 
 * index array (size = number of indices * number of languages
 * 
 * for each index in the array:
 *   unsigned byte - the font ID for the index
 *   unsigned byte[3] - the offset of the string codepoint data in
 *                      the table
 * 
 * string data is found by jumping to the index offset from the start
 * of the table
 * 
 * string data entry:
 *     unsigned short - length of the string in bytes (encoding dependent)
 *     codepoint data - the string data
