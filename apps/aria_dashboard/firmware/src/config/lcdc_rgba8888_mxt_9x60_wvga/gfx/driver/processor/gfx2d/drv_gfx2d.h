  GFX GFX2D Driver Interface Declarations for Static Single Instance Driver

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    drv_gfx2d.h

  Summary:
    GFX GFX2D driver interface declarations for the static single instance driver.

  Description:
    The GFX2D device driver provides a simple interface to manage the GFX2D
    module on Microchip microcontrollers. This file defines the interface
    Declarations for the GFX2D driver.

  Remarks:
    Static interfaces incorporate the driver instance number within the names
    of the routines, eliminating the need for an object ID or object handle.

    Static single-open interfaces also eliminate the need for the open handle.

   Summary:
    Copy a source buffer to the the destination buffer

   Description:
    The specified region of the source buffer is copied to the specified region
    of the destination buffer. If the regions are different in size, simple low-quality
    scaling will automatically be performed.

    An optional blend mode can be specified that defines the blending of the
