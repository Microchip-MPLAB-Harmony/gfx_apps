/* Structure:
    struct leDisplayDriver

  Summary:
    Defines the interface for a Legato display driver.  All drivers must,
    at a minimum, implement these interfaces

    getColorMode - returns the supported color mode for the driver

    getBufferCount - returns the number of buffers the driver is configured to use

    getDisplayWidth - returns the width of the driver frame buffer

    getDisplayHeight - returns the height of the driver frame buffer

    update - the driver tasks/update function

    getLayerCount - the number of hardware layers the driver supports

    getActiveLayer - the current active hardware layer

    setActiveLayer - sets the current active hardware layer
                     all buffer writes should go to this layer

    blitBuffer - instructs the driver to blit a buffer (buf) at
                 location (x, y)

    swap - instructs the driver to swap its buffer chain

    getVSYNCCount - queries the driver for its VSYNC counter
                    if a driver implements this counter this value
                    can be used to do frame rate calculations
