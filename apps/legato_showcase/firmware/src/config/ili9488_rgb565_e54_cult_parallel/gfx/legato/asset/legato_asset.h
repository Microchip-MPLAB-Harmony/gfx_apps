  Summary:
    A memory read request function is a request that is issued by anything that
    needs external support to access data that is stored in some external
    location.  For instance, an image may be stored in an SPI memory chip.
    A JPEG decoder has no knowledge of what SPI is.  This read request is issued
    to the application so that the application can then assume responsibility for
    communication with the peripherial to retrieve the data.  If the reader pointer
    or the callback pointer are null then the read request must be serviced 
    immediately.  In other words, the requesting decoder does not support
    non-blocking streaming.
    
    From the reader the handler can determine which asset is being decoded and
    which media it resides in.

    reader - the reader requesting the media data
    address - the requested source address
    size - the requested data size
    buf - the destination data address
