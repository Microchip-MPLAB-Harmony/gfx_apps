  Summary:
    Implementation of a Drawsurface widget.

  Description:
    A draw surface widget is a special widget that allows an application to
    perform custom HAL draw calls during Aria's paint loop.  To use, create
    and add a draw surface widget to the desired place in the widget tree.
    Then register for the callback through the API
    'laDrawSurfaceWidget_SetDrawCallback'.  This callback occurs during the
    paint loop.  The application should then be free to adjust the HAL
    draw state and issue draw calls as desired.  The HAL layer, buffer, or
    context state must not be adjusted in any way.

    It is also important to not stall for too long during the draw callback.

  Remarks:
    None.

  Description:
    Allocates memory for a new DrawSurface widget.  The application is
    responsible for the managment of this memory until the widget is added to
    a widget tree.

  Parameters:
    void

  Summary:
    Sets the draw callback pointer for the draw surface widget.

  Description:
    Sets the draw callback pointer for the draw surface widget.  This callback will
    be called during Aria's paint loop and allows the application to perform
    HAL draw calls.  The application should not adjust HAL layer, buffer, or context
    options in any way during this phase.

    The callback should return GFX_TRUE if it has completed drawing.  Returning
    GFX_FALSE will indicate to the renderer that the DrawSurface requires more
    time to draw and will call it again during the next paint loop.

  Parameters:
    laDrawSurfaceWidget* sfc - the widget
    laDrawSurfaceWidget_DrawCallback - a valid callback pointer or NULL

  Returns:
    laResult - the result of the operation
