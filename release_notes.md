### KNOWN ISSUES

The current known issues are as follows:

* The ICD4 loads the reset line of the SAM V71 Xplained Ultra board. The following demo project drives the reset line and requires the ICD4 flex cable to be removed after programming to run the application.

* Applications are compliant to MISRA C 2012 Mandatory guidelines, except for Rules R.9.1 and R.17.3

* Applications for PIC32MZ DA using external DDR are only supported on Rev B0 silicon.
