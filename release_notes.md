### KNOWN ISSUES

The current known issues are as follows:

* Code is compliant to MISRA C 2012 Mandatory guidelines, with the exception of Rule 9.1 (Code 530).
In gfx.c, the variable args is falsely detected in violation of Code 530: &quot;Symbol not initialized&quot; at line 358.  In fact, va_start at line 358 is exactly where args is initialized.

* When regenerating demo applications, keep all code between comments “//CUSTOM CODE…” and “//END OF CUSTOM CODE…”. Custom code is added to perform specific functionality.
* Applications running on SAM E70 in combination with LCC will observe visual rendering artifacts on display during SD card R/W access. There is no loss in SD Card data.
