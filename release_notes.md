### KNOWN ISSUES

The current known issues are as follows:

* Code is compliant to MISRA C 2012 Mandatory guidelines, with the exception of Rule 9.1 (Code 530). 
In gfx.c, the variable args is falsely detected in violation of Code 530: &quot;Symbol not initialized&quot; at line 358.  In fact, va_start at line 358 is exactly where args is initialized.

* Applications for PIC32MZ DA using external DDR are only supported on Rev A1 silicon.
* When using MHC v3.3.1 to re-generate aria_dashboard, aria_infotainment, and aria_radial_menu
applications, keep "//CUSTOM CODE", do not except recommended changes for file: libaria_init.c.
